/// A protocol for defining an ``Attributable`` that represents data using a `complex`
/// ``Attribute``. This protocol allows a cleaner implementation by providing default
/// paths to the respective complex data (both fields and values). To implement
/// this protocol, the user need only provide a container that stores the data
/// and the path to the complex attribute stored within it by setting the
/// `path` property of the conforming type. Once these paths are set up, the user
/// must provide the properties within the complex attribute as local properties
/// of the conforming type using the property wrappers for the respective attributes.
/// 
/// Consider a `Person` whom is representeed as a *complex attribute*. A person may contain
/// 3 properties - namely *first_name*, *last_name*, and *age*. You may conform this *Person*
/// to this protocol by adopting the structure below.
/// ```swift
/// struct Person: ComplexProtocol {
///
///     typealias Root = EmptyModifiable 
/// 
///     let path = Path(EmptyModifiable.self).attributes[0].attributes["person"].wrappedValue
/// 
///     var data: EmptyModifiable
/// 
///     @LineProperty(label: "first_name")
///     var firstName
/// 
///     @LineProperty(label: "last_name")
///     var lastName
/// 
///     @IntegerProperty(label: "age")
///     var age
/// 
/// }
/// ```
/// Note that the `Person` struct is using an ``EmptyModifiable`` to store it's data in the *person*
/// attribute. Each of the properties are defined with default validation and triggers as not to complicate
/// this small example. In summary, the struct above denotes a *Person* as a *complex attribute* that
/// contains two line attributes (*first_name* & *last_name), and an integer attribute (*age*).
public protocol ComplexProtocol: Attributable where AttributeRoot == Attribute {

    /// All of the triggers for each attribute contained within this complex.
    var triggers: AnyTrigger<Root> { get }

    /// The validators for the attributes contained within this complex.
    @ValidatorBuilder<Attribute>
    var groupValidation: AnyValidator<AttributeRoot> { get }

    ///  The validator for the root object that contains the complex attribute.
    @ValidatorBuilder<Root>
    var rootValidation: AnyValidator<Root> { get }

}

/// Default implementations.
public extension ComplexProtocol {

    /// The path to the complex attributes fields.
    var pathToFields: Path<Attribute, [Field]> {

    }

    /// The path to the complex attributes values.
